# ðŸ˜‚ Welcome to Testr! ðŸ˜‚

Hey there, curious wanderer! You've just stumbled into the wild and wacky world of **Testr** â€” the only repo where bugs are considered pets and typos are badges of honor.

## What is Testr?

Honestly, we're still figuring that out. Some say it's a revolutionary project. Some say it's just a collection of random files. All we know is... it's here, and it's *glorious*.

## Features

- **Runs code (sometimes)**
- **Breaks code (frequently)**
- **Makes you question reality (always)**
- **100% guaranteed to contain at least one bug**
- **Now with extra confusion!**

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo like a pro:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kederaff/testr.git
   ```
2. Stare at the code. Marvel at its beauty. Or horror. Your call.
3. Try to run something. Anything.
4. Celebrate your errors. They are proof of your existence.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially if you:
- Write code that nobody understands.
- Add comments that make things even less clear.
- Fix bugs by introducing new ones.

Just make a PR and we'll probably merge it while laughing.

## License

This project is licensed under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/). Do what you want. Seriously.

May your tests be green, your errors be hilarious, and your coffee cup never empty. Enjoy **Testr**!
