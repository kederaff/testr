# Modern CSS Demo

This demo showcases a few modern CSS features:

- Declarative cross-page transitions enabled via the View Transitions API.
- The `:has()` selector to style a card when its image is hovered.
- Container queries to adapt card layout when the container is wide enough.
- `color-mix()` to blend colors declaratively.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to explore the examples.
